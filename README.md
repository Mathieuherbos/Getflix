## Planning & Organisation

### Project team

* Nicolas Saeys
* Khadija El Khadri
* Mathieu Herbos
* Ashleigh Templeton

### Task management & project handling

The development team utilised scrum methodology to manage the project tasks. 
They used:
* Trello to manage the development process of key tasks;
* Figma to update the web design;
* Google docs to share resources, login details, notes, etc.;
* Discord for communication

A morning and afternoon meeting were held each day to ensure active communication on the progress of tasks and common understanding of the project's direction. Meetings were also held in the afternoon and when needed throughout the day between members and the group. 
Each team member was always connected to their discord vocal channel in case help or clarification was ever needed.

The first concept/template of the home page, of which we made the initial database and JS tests with, was made with bootstrap



*Inspiration for the design of this site was taken from Netflix*
